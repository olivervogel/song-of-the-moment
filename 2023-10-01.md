## New Order - 1963 (1987)

This track seems cheerful and danceable when listened to inattentively.
Shimmering synths combined with a melodic bass line make it seem like a classical
1980s electronic post-punk song. The lyrics, however, provide a particularly
dark contrast. New Order offer the listener a cryptic story that gives the song
a certain depth and uniqueness, leaving you unsettled and with an unconditional
desire to listen to the track again and again.
