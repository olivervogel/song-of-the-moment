Clear cold winter nights, the streets are empty and the first snowflakes are
the only accompaniment. You can tell that the summer is finally over. However,
this calm, wonderful song provides a certain comfort and will brighten your day 
in those lonely moments. And next year you will remember this day and you will know
that "Times were good for awhile".
