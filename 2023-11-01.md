This quote from the artist himself best describes his insanely beautiful
electronic music and this angelic song in particular:

“I think things have always been crap, it’s just that when I was a child, the
future seemed exciting. Now I’m an adult, the future seems terrifying. And I
would like to go back to a time when the future seemed optimistic. That, as
much as anything, is the core of what I’m getting at. I’m nostalgic for an
optimistic future.”

&mdash; Gordon Chapman-Fox
