## Perlee - Pomegranate (2023)

Perfect for the fall mood where everything is falling apart and you feel a sense
of sadness, but deep down you know that this is all right. The first part of
the song starts with dreamlike sounds and teleports the listener into another
world to the mixed male and female vocals, while the droning guitars and drums
get more and more aggressive and finally replace the relaxation. 

In the last third you fall in love with this song forever. The mood shifts into
a sudden calm, into an unexpected dreamlike world of love where, accompanied by
the tender vocals, you wonder if you could stay in this world forever. “But
you can't ask a stranger things like that”.

My personal song of the year 2023!
