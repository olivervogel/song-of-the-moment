A calm and captivating ambient masterpiece that slowly unfolds its magic.
Accompanied by angelic vocals, jazzy trumpet sounds and meditative drums, the
listener is immersed in deeper and deeper levels like in a dream. You forget
everything around you as the song unfolds and more instruments join the
gorgeous soundscape. As you slowly make your way back to the surface from
minute 7:50, you'll feel a pleasant warmth and a sense of peace that won't be
forgotten when you return to reality after the almost 12-minute fantastic
journey.
