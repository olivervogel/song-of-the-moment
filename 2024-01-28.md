## Ian William Craig - Arrive, Arrive (2017)

You don't need much when you're blessed with a phenomenal voice like that. A simple guitar
as accompaniment is enough to make a memorable impression. So lasting, so
monumental in its simplicity, that you return to this song over and over again to rest your 
head on this musical shoulder, sensing a feeling that you will truly arrive at some point, 
that the circle will close and everything will be ok.
