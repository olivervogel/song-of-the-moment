## Ian William Craig - Arrive, Arrive (2017)

You don't need much when you're blessed with a phenomenal voice like that. A
simple guitar as accompaniment is enough to make a memorable impression. So
lasting, so monumental in its simplicity, that you return to this song over and
over again to rest your head on this musical shoulder, sensing a feeling that
the circle will close at some point and everything will be ok.
