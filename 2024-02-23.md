They say the only constant in life is change. MGMT see things differently and
take the listener into their world of synth-pop with sounds slightly
reminiscent of "The Cure". The crisp bass line, the pure acoustic guitars mixed
with catchy synths surrounds you like a warm musical blanket and awakens the
faint idea that after a long, dark winter there maybe will be warmth and light
again sometime.

Besides the grand finale, my personal favorite moment of the song
is at about 02:28, where you are suddenly hit by a bass drum, accompanied by
some kind of distorted harmonica sound. You find yourself in one of those
fascinating moments and you know for sure that the great quality of MGMT really
never changes.

My personal favorite from their new album.
