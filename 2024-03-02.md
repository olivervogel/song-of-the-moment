Melancholy and pop have never sounded better. The song flows effortlessly with
a instrumental simplicity rarely heard. The lyrics, which deal with
vulnerability, create a brilliant contrast to the pop theme. Halfway through,
the vocals fall silent and for the rest of the song the listener slowly drifts
into an almost meditative guitar outro that you wish would never end.
