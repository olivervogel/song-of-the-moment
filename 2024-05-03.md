Listening to stories is not just for children. Slowly immersing in a fantastic
fictional world and being completely lost in the moment can also happen to
adults. The Clientele let you listen to every single word of their lyrics
with excitement. This song opens a way to leave the present moment, and gifts
you with four minutes of captivating mystical narration of a person who wanders
through the city and finds himself suddenly in a photograph from 1982 and
experiences again a long lost feeling that reminds him of a better time.
Disturbing and incredibly beautiful at the same time.
