“What comes after this, momentary bliss?” The answer to that question is a
resounding yes! A song that makes you float through an endless landscape of
pink clouds. By the time the ethereal choir kick in after the first chorus,
you get the feeling that everything in this track makes sense; and when the
vibrato-laden guitar outro is introduced at the end, it doesn't just mean the
song, but the entire existence of the universe.
