The Clientele again! This time “Saturday” showcases the band’s unique ability
to craft captivating lo-fi songs. Almost demo-like the songs comes with a
wonderful sense of fragility that enhances its raw emotional impact. The
restrained fingerstyle guitar is a perfect match to the distinctive Clientele
vocals, which in combination with the poetic lyrics create a incomparable
soothing and relaxing atmosphere.
