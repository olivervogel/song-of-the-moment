I have to admit that I have a bit of a weakness for pathos in the music I
listen to, and boy does this song hit the spot!

Starting with pastoral church bells in the background which are gently
accompanied by a gorgeous piano chord progression. Just listening to this intro
alone awakens the faint idea that this song will be something really special.
But it's the angelic choir singing that gives the track its real charm,
creating that certain lovely aura of nostaligia that will bring tears to the
eyes of even the toughest of men. If I had to come up with a song that would
condense all the happy moments of my life into four and a half minutes, it
would sound exactly like this evocative masterpiece.
