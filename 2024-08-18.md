This song is more than just a melody. With its flowing lightness and rich cello
play, it breathes a feeling of both happiness and sadness at the same time. A
perception of being in the moment and looking back, a tone of coming back to
life. It sounds like that one moment that stands for the transition out of a
period of darkness and symbolizes the joyful beginning of a new phase with new
life and growth. 

There are songs that you hear for the first time and fall in love instantly -
this is one of them.

My personal song of the year 2024!
