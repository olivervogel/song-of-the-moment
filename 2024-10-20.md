## Marta Mist - Always On (2023)

This musical work of art makes time and space disappear. For over 14 minutes,
you'll be drawn into a trance-like state while violins and synthesizers
alternate as if in an endless cosmic cycle. The dreamlike atmosphere will
captivate you and only let's you go when the song ends and you'll be brought
back to reality by the reverberating piano chords and samples. This is the
epitome of ambient.
