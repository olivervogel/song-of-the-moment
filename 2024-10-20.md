This musical work of art makes time and space disappear. For over 14 minutes,
you'll be drawn into a trance-like state while violins sounds alternate as if
in an endless cosmic cycle. The dreamlike atmosphere will captivate you and
only let's you go when the song ends and you'll be brought back to reality by
the reverberating piano chords and samples. This is the epitome of ambient.
