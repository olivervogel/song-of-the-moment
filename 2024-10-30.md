This is the modern version of Linda Smith's song, originally released in 1996,
whose lyrics are a poem by English poet Charlotte Mew.

A bitter-sweet song full of heartache and loss, about the ever-returning spring
that seems forever painfully linked to past times with a loved one. The real
magic, however, is the turn towards hope. This gives the song an elegant ending
that celebrates the healing power of nature and the cyclical rhythm of life
that allows one to find peace in the present moment.
