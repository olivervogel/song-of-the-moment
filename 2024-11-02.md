## C. Diab - The Excuse of Fiction

The Canadian artist succeeds to bring the listener to a almost meditative state
with a interplay of electronic musical elements making the song seem like an
dreamlike experience. Diab's skilful use of mournful violin-like sound layers
and gentle drums evokes a sense of wonder and discovery, as if the listener is
traversing the ever-evolving cosmos.
