The Canadian artist manages to put the listener into an almost meditative state
with an interplay of electronic musical elements that make the song seem like a
dreamlike experience. Diab's skilful use of mournful violin-like sound layers
and gentle drums evoke a sense of wonder and discovery, as if the listener is
traversing the ever-evolving cosmos.
