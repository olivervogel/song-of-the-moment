## CS + Kreme - Corey (2024)

Humming vocals combined with a beautiful guitar arrangement, scattered samples
of wonderfully odd noises, united in a way that is absolutely harmonious. This
is the opening track of the album "The Butterfly Drinks The Tears Of The
Tortoise" by the australian arists Conrad Standish and Sam Karmel and it's
gorgeous, like the whole album.
