## Mogwai - Mogwai Fear Satan (1997)

An epic, operatic, post-rock masterpiece that begins with heavy electric
guitars and driving drums, and at some point in its 16+ minute length arrives
at a meditative, melancholic flute playing. It is this constant alternation
between quiet and loud, black and white, good and evil that makes this track so
epochal and carries the listener off into fascinating, almost transcendental
worlds of sound.
