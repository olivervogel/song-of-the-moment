## Perlee - Bad Night's Sleep (2023)

Another work of art from the Irish dream-pop duo, perfect for a rainy New
Year's morning. This time it's Saramai Leech's wonderful voice that I love the
most. Together with the full guitar chords, they turn the song into a musical
treat that will stay with you for a very long time, if not forever.
