First you expect Vapor Trail to behave like a well-trained post-rock song: rise
from a slow burn into something dramatic, but the big moment turns out to be
only a modest guitar solo that arrives at the middle of the song,
nods politely and leaves without making eye contact.

Spectacular, on the other hand, is Anna-Lynne Williams' voice, which carries
the entire song and gives it its unique mood.

Perfect on a cold January morning in 2026, when the sky is gray and optimism
is technically still alive but clearly not thriving. This Song doesn't try to
save you from that mood. It simply sits beside you, which, honestly, feels so
much more like pure love.
