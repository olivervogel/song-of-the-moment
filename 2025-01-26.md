## Mogwai - Cody (1999)

I somehow missed Mogwai back when this song was released, but discovering it
now feels like finding a treasure. Written and sung by Stuart Braithwaite, this
track shows the slower and calmer side of the band, which stands in contrast to
their signature instrumental epics. 

"Cody" is wonderfully restrained with a rather subtle instrumentation. But make
no mistake it is precisely this deliberate pace that makes the atmosphere of
the song so impressive. The lyrics are gripping, beautifully sad and drenched
in nostalgia, painting pictures of times gone by. There is a yearning in every
line carried by Braithwait's understated yet expressive voice, which make this
song an timeless classic.
