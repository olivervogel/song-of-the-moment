A slow and mellow track that blends reduced guitar instrumentation with emotive
lyrics and creates a fragile foundation, while the mechanical auto-tuned vocals
add a detached yet deeply expressive quality. The final third of this beautiful
piece is characterised by a slightly more uplifting mood, offering a delicate
contrast that feels both unexpected and cathartic. 

My personal song of the year 2025!
