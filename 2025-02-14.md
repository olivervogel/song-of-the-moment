## claire rousay - it could be anything (2024)

A slow and mellow track that blends reduced guitar instrumentation with emotive
lyrics and creates a fragile foundation, while the mechanical auto-tuned vocals
add a detached yet deeply expressive quality. The final third of this beautiful
piece is characterised by a slightly more uplifting mood, offering a delicate
contrast that feels both unexpected and cathartic.
