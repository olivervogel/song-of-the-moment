## Organi - Remembering Anna (2024)

This song perfectly captures the nostalgic charm that defines Organi’s album
"Babylonia". Drenched in 60s and 70s influences, the song radiates a feel-good
atmosphere that’s both warm and irresistibly catchy. With melodies reminiscent
of France Gall’s work in the 60s, it lingers in the mind long after the last
note fades. Like the rest of "Babylonia", this track is highly recommended!
