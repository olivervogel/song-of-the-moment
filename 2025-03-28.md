Dan Deacon’s "When I Was Done Dying" is a whirlwind of sound and emotion,
bursting with relentless energy and vibrant creativity. Deacon crafts a song
that feels both chaotic and euphoric reminding me of a blend between Animal
Collective´s vocals and Mika´s theatricality.

I came across the track through the German TV series "Dark", which I'm only now
watching with a few years’ delay. Deacon's storytelling in this song, surreal
and poetic, is a surprisingly fitting choice for the series, which actually
strikes a quieter tone. But just like the show, the song feels otherworldly,
experimental in its many layers of sound, much like the layers of time in
"Dark".
