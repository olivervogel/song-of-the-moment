## Beirut - Tuanaki Atoll (2025)

The third single from the upcoming album "A Study Of Losses" is another gem.
Rooted in the band's signature orchestral pop aesthetic, the track unfolds like
a gentle tide - somehow wistful and deeply transporting.

Built around the sustained vocals of Zach Condon, "Tuanaki Atoll" evokes for me
the image of a slow-swaying sailing ship drifting across calm waters. This
track sticks in your head. Having already been charmed by the earlier singles,
particularly the beautiful "Guericke's Unicorn", I'm more convinced
than ever that this album will be one of my standout records this year.
