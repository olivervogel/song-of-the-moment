Andrew Weatherall's remix of "Fed-Ex To München" by Radioactive Man is a
masterclass in atmospheric depth. From the get-go, the song radiates a mood
that feels epic and subliminal melancholic at the same time.

Weatherall created a majestic reinterpretation that reminds me of driving
through a dystopian, futuristic, foggy city at night. The most prominent feature
is the rumbling bass line that serves as the perfect foundation for the
spectral distorted synth motifs that seem to come from some unseen world.
Electronic elegance doesn't get any better than this.
