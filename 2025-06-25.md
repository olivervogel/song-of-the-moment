A hidden treasure from the early '70s, "Sweet Mountain" by American Spring is a
dreamy, sun-drenched tune that floats somewhere between girl group nostalgia
and Beach Boys experimentation. Featuring Marilyn Wilson then-wife of Brian
Wilson this track bears his unmistakable musical fingerprints.

Co-written and produced by Brian Wilson and David Sandler, "Sweet Mountain"
opens with a slow, harmonious section before leaping into bright, piano-driven
driven passages that bubble with California optimism.

While it may not have been a commercial success, the track is a sweet slice of
baroque-pop psychedelia. Unmistakably a product of its time, yet today, more
than 50 years later, it has become timelessly beautiful.
