This deeply sentimental song by Blonde Redhead explores the weight of nostalgia
and dwelling in the past. Though there's an overall touch of kitsch, the song
maintains its sincerity, largely thanks to its unusual arrangement and rather
unexpected chord changes, which keep listeners interested. Compared to the
original, this new arrangement featuring the Brooklyn Youth Choir takes the
song to another level, amplifying its emotional depth with a unique vibe. It's
easy to fall in love with this song - a captivating blend of nostalgia, beauty,
and the innocence of youth, all wrapped in a engaging performance.
