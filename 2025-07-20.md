This song is pure heartbreak served with a side of choir-led existential dread.
The Brooklyn Youth Choir does the rest and elevates every line to operatic
levels of emotional manipulation - you'll feel nostalgic and guilty in equal
measure. It flirts with kitsch but never loses sincerity, making it impossible
not to fall for this song. By the time this happens you’re either in tears or
considering talking to a horse for emotional support.
