I discovered this song back in the spring this year, but like most of any good
decisions, it took a few month to actually mean something. "Everyday" feels like
waking up in a quiet apocalypse but the kind where you still have coffee and a
faint memory of joy. Musically reduced to the bare minimum: a bass line, droning synths
and lyrics that stay in in your head but never pay rent.

The song is awesome in that quietly devastating Yo La Tengo way — romantic,
slightly blurred, like Paul Le Mat in 1980 driving off into the fog, never
realizing the world ended three exits back. Five stars!
