"When Things Are True Again" sounds like a version of ABBA that has been
meditating alone in the woods in a parallel universe for several years, quietly
lost faith in humanity.

It's Linda Perhacs' perfect angelic voice and the calm, acoustic arrangement
that makes you stare out the window for a very long time before you ask
yourself whether things will be "true again" after the apocalypse hits or
wether the first cup of coffee in the morning will be enough.

It's also the lyrics that make the song beautiful, powerful, and just
optimistic enough to make all the despair it conveys seem poetic.

10/10 for cosmic melancholy.
