The first three and a half minutes of this song are pure, hypnotic harp spirals
— the ones that make you question time, space, and whether you've just slipped into
another dimension or are simply dealing with the consequences of last night's
choices.

This blissful disorientation continues until Julianna's angelic voice drifts in
and returns you, at least partially, to the mortal realm.

The reverb is so thick it turns the lyrics into a distant, poetic fog — which
is honestly ideal, really - actual comprehension would only ruin the vibe. This
isn't a song you just listen; it's a song you surrender to.
