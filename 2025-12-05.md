What a magnificent piece of premium-grade schmaltz. Truly, if sentimentality
were a liquid, this track would require a mop. Sturgill tops it off with that
haunted Johnny-Cash-after-a-long-night timbre, delivering a romance so sugary
it could give your dentist nightmares — and yet, against all odds, it somehow
absolutely works.

Maybe it's because I first heard it in "The Leftovers", a tv-show where everyone is
one emotional breakdown away from hugging a blender. In that context, this song
feels less like a country ballad and more like an inside joke: Yes, the
world is ending, but at least the soundtrack is great.

"The Promise" is also an excelent karaoke choice for declaring your undying
devotion to someone who, let's be honest, would rather be anywhere else. 

It's painful, it's dramatic, it's perfect.
